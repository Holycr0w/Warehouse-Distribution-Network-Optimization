 A major supermarket is updating its delivery network. They have 2 main warehouses
 (W1 and W2) and 23 stores at locations (1-23). Each day they must carry out a daily
 delivery from their two warehouses to all 23 stores, with the vehicles returning to the
 warehouses at the end of the day. The geographical locations of the sites are shown below:
 
 (The location coordinates and distance matrix is available in an Excel file.)
 There are two types of vehicle that the supermarket can use:
 Cost per mile Maximum stores it can supply
           Van    Lorry
CPM         £1     £2
Stores      4      16
 Given the aim is to minimise the total daily costs, find the best strategy such that
 every store receives its delivery and the warehouses have the correct number of vehicles at
 the end of the day to carry out the deliveries the following day.
 Questions: Which stores should each warehouse supply? How many vans or lorries does
 each warehouse require? What routes should each vehicle take? What is the total cost?
